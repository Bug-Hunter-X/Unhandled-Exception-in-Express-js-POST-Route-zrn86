# Express.js Unhandled Exception Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inadequate error handling during database operations.  The `bug.js` file showcases a POST route that lacks proper error handling, leading to potential crashes or unhelpful 500 errors.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the application: `node bug.js`
4. Send a POST request to `/users` without error handling. Observe the response or console logs.
5. Run the solution `node bugSolution.js` and observe improved error handling.

## Bug

The primary issue lies in the absence of robust error handling within the database callback. Unhandled exceptions during database interactions can lead to application crashes or non-descriptive 500 responses, hindering debugging efforts.
